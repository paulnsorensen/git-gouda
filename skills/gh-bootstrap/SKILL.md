# gh-bootstrap

One-shot repository configuration for the **merge-queue + squash-merge + auto-release-notes** pattern.

This is one-time repo policy, distinct from per-task GitHub operations: how should this repo be configured in the first place?

## What gets configured

| Concern | Result | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Repo merge defaults | Squash-only; PR title → commit subject; delete branches on merge | `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}` |
| Default branch protection | Ruleset with PR and required checks, no force-push, no deletion; optional queue | `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` |
| Release notes | `.github/release.yml` with category buckets driven by PR labels | File commit |
| Release workflow (optional) | Tag push → `gh release create --generate-notes` on the discovered default branch | File commit |

All policy endpoints (repo settings, rulesets, branch protection) run through the `gh` CLI — `gh api` for the JSON endpoints, `gh repo`/`gh release` where there's a first-class subcommand. The skill writes files (`.github/release.yml`, the optional release workflow) directly to the working tree.

## Protocol

### 1. Confirm scope and inspect current state

Before changing anything, read the runway and confirm with the user:

```bash
gh auth status
REPO="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')"
gh repo view "$REPO" --json nameWithOwner,visibility,defaultBranchRef,isPrivate
DEFAULT_BRANCH="$(gh repo view "$REPO" --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')"
gh api "repos/$REPO" --jq '{
  squash:   .allow_squash_merge,
  merge:    .allow_merge_commit,
  rebase:   .allow_rebase_merge,
  delete:   .delete_branch_on_merge,
  title:    .squash_merge_commit_title,
  body:     .squash_merge_commit_message,
  auto:     .allow_auto_merge
}'
gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets"                                        # any rulesets already?
gh api "repos/$REPO/branches/$DEFAULT_BRANCH/protection" 2>/dev/null # legacy branch protection?
```

Ask the user:

- Default branch (assume the repo's `defaultBranchRef`, usually `main`)
- Required status check **names** (e.g. `validate / validate skills`, `ci`, `test`) — these must match what CI emits
- Required approving review count (default `1`; `0` is fine for solo repos)
- Whether to scaffold the optional release workflow, or just `.github/release.yml`

**Merge queue availability.** GitHub supports merge queues on public organization-owned repositories and on private organization-owned repositories with GitHub Enterprise Cloud. A user-owned repository, including a public user-owned repository, is not eligible. Skip the `merge_queue` rule unless the repository and plan meet those requirements.

### 2. Set repo merge defaults

Single `PATCH` lands all the merge-button settings atomically:

```bash
gh api -X PATCH "repos/$REPO" \
  -F allow_squash_merge=true \
  -F allow_merge_commit=false \
  -F allow_rebase_merge=false \
  -F allow_auto_merge=true \
  -F delete_branch_on_merge=true \
  -F squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE \
  -F squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY
```

Why each flag:

- `allow_squash_merge=true`, `allow_merge_commit=false`, `allow_rebase_merge=false` — squash is the only button on a merged PR, so `main` history is one commit per merged PR.
- `delete_branch_on_merge=true` — the branch is gone anyway once it's been collapsed into one commit; no point keeping the ref.
- `squash_merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE` — the squash commit's subject line is the PR title verbatim. This makes `git log --oneline` on `main` read as a list of merged PRs.
- `squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY` — the PR body becomes the commit body, so the rationale for each change survives in `git log` without needing GitHub.
- `allow_auto_merge=true` — required for the merge queue button to enqueue PRs without human babysitting.

`PATCH` is idempotent: re-running with the same values is a no-op.

### 3. Lock the default branch with a ruleset

Rulesets are GitHub's modern replacement for branch protection — they support merge queues as a first-class rule, layer cleanly with org rulesets, and are queryable via the API. Default to a ruleset; only fall back to classic branch protection if the user explicitly asks (e.g. they are pinned to an older GHE version).

The full payloads, the asset templates, and the create-vs-update logic live in `references/ruleset.md` — read that file before this step. The no-queue variant ships as an asset:

| Variant | Asset | Pick when |
|---|---|---|
| `main: PR + CI` | `assets/rulesets/main-pr-ci.json` | Solo or small repo. Squash-only via `allowed_merge_methods: ["squash"]`, 0 required reviews, single CI check, no merge queue. |
| `main-protection` (queue) | inline JSON in `references/ruleset.md` | Team repo with concurrent PR throughput. Adds the `merge_queue` rule, ≥1 review, matrix of CI checks. |

Both variants share the same shape:

- `target: "branch"`, `conditions.ref_name.include: ["~DEFAULT_BRANCH"]`
- `enforcement: "active"`
- Rules: `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `pull_request`, `required_status_checks`

Default to the `main: PR + CI` variant unless the user explicitly asks for the merge queue. It's the simpler shape and the one that matches everyday solo work.

**Idempotency:** list rulesets and look for one targeting the default branch whose name matches either bootstrap variant (`main: PR + CI` or `main-protection`). If found, `GET` it, diff its `rules`, `bypass_actors`, and `conditions` against the rendered payload, show the diff, and ask the user before `PUT`-ing. When the user switches variants, reuse that ruleset's id for the `PUT` instead of creating a second one, and ask before disabling or retiring anything from the prior variant. If absent, `POST` a new one. Never create a duplicate ruleset for the default branch.

### 4. Scaffold the release-notes config

Copy `assets/release.yml` to `.github/release.yml`. This file is consumed by GitHub's auto-generated release notes (the "Generate release notes" button on the New Release page, and `gh release create --generate-notes`). It groups merged PRs into Breaking / Features / Fixes / Docs / Internal / Other buckets driven by PR labels.

If `.github/release.yml` already exists, diff it against the template and ask before overwriting. Don't silently clobber the user's existing categories.

### 5. Scaffold the release workflow (optional)

If the user opted in, copy `assets/release-workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow:

- Triggers on `push` to `v*` tags
- Runs a `verify` job (`contents: read`, `persist-credentials: false`) that checks out the repo, discovers the default branch, and refuses to continue if the tag is not its ancestor — so unreviewed branches can't ship a release. Add the caller's setup and quality gate to this job.
- Runs a `publish` job (`contents: write`, `needs: verify`, no checkout) that calls `gh release create "$TAG" --generate-notes --verify-tag`, adding `--prerelease` when the tag contains a `-`

Splitting `verify` from `publish` keeps the job that checks out and gates repository code from ever holding `contents: write`. Action SHAs are pinned (not floating tags) for supply-chain hygiene. `references/release.md` documents which actions are pinned and how to refresh them when a new version comes out.

### 6. Verify and report

Re-read everything and print a small summary table to the user. Don't claim success without reading the post-state back from the API.

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO" --jq '{
  squash: .allow_squash_merge, merge: .allow_merge_commit, rebase: .allow_rebase_merge,
  delete: .delete_branch_on_merge, title: .squash_merge_commit_title, body: .squash_merge_commit_message
}'
gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets" --jq '.[] | {id, name, enforcement, target, reviews: ([.rules[] | select(.type=="pull_request") | .parameters.required_approving_review_count][0])}'
test -f .github/release.yml          && echo "release.yml present"
test -f .github/workflows/release.yml && echo "release workflow present"
```

The summary should call out:

- What was changed
- What was already correct (no-op)
- What was skipped (e.g. merge queue on a private free-tier repo) and why

## Idempotency rules

The skill is designed to be re-run safely on a partially-configured repo:

- **Repo settings:** `PATCH` is idempotent — re-applying the same body is a no-op response.
- **Rulesets:** lookup by either bootstrap variant name targeting the default branch. If found, diff and ask before `PUT`; reuse its id when switching variants. `POST` if absent. Never duplicate.
- **`.github/release.yml`:** diff before overwriting; ask if the content differs.
- **Release workflow:** same — diff and ask.
- **Never delete:** if a previous run left an artifact (e.g. a legacy classic branch-protection rule alongside the new ruleset), surface it for the user to decide. Don't quietly remove it.

## What this skill is NOT for

- Per-task GitHub ops (PRs, issues, CI status, releases for a specific tag) — out of scope
- Local git operations — out of scope
- Pre-commit hooks — use `/prek`
- Project task running — out of scope
- Designing a CI pipeline — out of scope; this skill writes one specific release workflow if asked, no more
- Backfilling status check names into a repo whose CI doesn't emit them yet — it tells you what names to use, you wire them in your CI

## Gotchas

- Required status check names must match exactly what your CI emits in the Checks API. After a green run on a PR, run `gh api repos/$REPO/commits/<sha>/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[].name'` to see the real names — silent typos will fail to gate merges.
- Squash merge with `squash_merge_commit_message=PR_BODY` puts the entire PR description into the commit body. Encourage clean PR bodies; sloppy ones become permanent commit history.
- Rulesets require admin permission on the repo (or org-level rulesets if applied at org scope). A token with only push/PR scopes will get a 403 here.
- Auto-generated release notes only categorize **merged PRs**, not direct commits. The default-branch ruleset blocks direct pushes, which is what makes release notes complete in the first place — these features reinforce each other.
- Use a merge queue only when GitHub eligibility is confirmed. A user-owned repository cannot use this rule even when it is public. Keep merge commits disabled at the repo level.
- If the "Merge when ready" button is missing from a PR view after this skill runs, double-check that both `allow_auto_merge=true` (repo-level) and the ruleset's `merge_queue` rule landed.
